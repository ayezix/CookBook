Technical Architecture

Architecture Pattern
The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with Repository pattern:

┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│      View       │    │   ViewModel      │    │     Model       │
│   (Activities   │◄──►│   (Business      │◄──►│  (Data Models   │
│   & Fragments)  │    │    Logic)        │    │   & Repository) │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
